**_Aim: -_ ** Downloading and Installing VS Code; {Hello World and Calculator program}

**Downloading and Installing**

**Theory: - ** 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is widely used by developers for its lightweight nature and powerful features. Here are some key aspects of VS Code:

1. **Code Editing**: It provides a rich editing experience with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (code completion), and code navigation features.

2. **Extensions**: VS Code supports a vast ecosystem of extensions that can enhance functionality, including language support, debuggers, linters, and tools for various workflows.

3. **Integrated Terminal**: It includes a built-in terminal that allows you to run shell commands directly within the editor.

4. **Version Control**: VS Code has built-in Git support, making it easy to manage source code repositories and perform version control tasks.

5. **Debugging**: It offers integrated debugging features, allowing you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.

6. **Customization**: You can customize the editor's appearance and behavior with themes, settings, and keybindings to suit your preferences.

7. **Cross-Platform**: VS Code runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it versatile for different development environments.

Overall, VS Code is designed to be a flexible and extensible tool that supports a wide range of programming languages and workflows.

**Procedure**
Download VS Code:

Go to the official Visual Studio Code website.
Click on the "Download for Windows" button. This will download an executable installer file (.exe).
Run the Installer:

Open the downloaded file (VSCodeSetup-x.x.x.exe).
Follow the installation prompts. You can choose the installation directory and configure additional options like adding VS Code to your PATH or creating a desktop icon.
Launch VS Code:

Once installed, you can launch VS Code from the Start menu or by double-clicking the desktop icon if you chose to create one.


**HELLO WORLD Program**
**Theory: - ** 
A "Hello, World!" program is a simple program used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It typically outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. This program serves as a basic introduction to the language, demonstrating how to write, compile, and run code.

**CALCULATOR Program**
**Theory: - ** 
Creating a calculator in C++ involves implementing basic arithmetic operations and handling user input and output. The theory behind building a simple calculator involves several key concepts:

Key Concepts
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
User Input:

Reading user input to determine which operation to perform and which numbers to use.
Control Flow:

Using conditional statements (e.g., if, switch) to select the appropriate operation based on user input.
Output:

Displaying results to the user.

**Output: - **
